# Progress Log

## Session: June 11, 2026

Work resumed after a pause since last summer. Three rounds of changes, each committed and pushed separately.

### Round 1 — Bug fixes + stats graphic integration

**Bugs fixed:**
- `getLastDiscard()` in `js/ui.js` referenced a bare `discard` variable that was never defined, throwing a ReferenceError when undoing a deck→discard draw. Added the missing `document.getElementById('discard')` lookup.
- `showWinScreen()` in `js/ui.js` used assignment (`winType = 'win'`) instead of comparison in its `else if`, so the "cleared the board" message could never display. Fixed to `===` and corrected the "cleared cleared" typo.
- Removed leftover `console.log` calls in `js/game.js` and `js/ui.js`.

**Stats graphic (the circular infographic) is now live:**
- New module `js/statsGraph.js` — ported `createWedgeSVG` (clockwise grey wedge = average score / 728), `createWedgeSVG_CCW` (counterclockwise red wedge = win % / 100), and `percentageOf180` from the `wedge test/` prototype folder. Exports `renderStatsGraph(container, {averageScore, winPercent}, idPrefix)` which builds the entire infographic (wedges + circleGraphic.png overlay + curved SVG text labels).
- `index.html` — the hardcoded infograph markup (fake "ave: 625.33 pts" / "win %: 22" values) was replaced with an empty `<div id="statsgraph"></div>` that JS fills.
- `js/ui.js` — `refreshStatsGraph()` helper renders into the header `#statsgraph`. Hooked into `updateGameStatsInfo()` (page load / new game), `updateEndGameStats()` (game end), and `resetGameStatsInfo()` (stats reset). Win % is computed as `gamesWon / gamesPlayed`, rounded.
- **Mobile (≤ 660px):** the header graphic is hidden by CSS at this width, so `showWinScreen()` injects a second copy into the win overlay (`#win-statsgraph` inside `#tableau-container`). SVG path ids use prefixes (`hdr-` / `win-`) so the two DOM copies never collide.
- `styles.css` — `#infograph-container`/`#graphic` id selectors became `.infograph-container`/`.graphic` classes (needed for two copies); added win-screen layout styles in the 660px media query (`.win-container` becomes block/auto-height, `#win` static, graph centered at 70% width capped at 300px).

### Round 2 — Disable the undo button when unusable

- `js/game.js`:
  - New `gameOver` module flag — set in `checkWinCondition()`, cleared in `startNewGame()`.
  - New exported `canUndo()` — true only when `moveHistory.length > 0`, `score >= undoCount + 1`, and `!gameOver`.
  - **Fixed latent bugs:** `startNewGame()` was never clearing `moveHistory` or resetting `undoCount`, so undo cost escalated across games and old-game moves could leak onto a fresh board. Both now reset.
  - `updateUndoButtonText()` is now called from `recordMove`, `recordDrawMove`, `addScore`, `subtractScore`, `checkWinCondition`, `startNewGame`, and `initGame` so button state tracks every relevant state change.
- `js/ui.js` — `updateUndoButtonText()` also toggles a `.disabled` class on `#undo` based on `canUndo()`.
- `js/events.js` — click handler returns early if the undo button has `.disabled` (no error toast; the "need more points" toast remains as a fallback deeper in the logic).
- `styles.css` — `.action-bttn.disabled`: 45% opacity, default cursor, press-down effect suppressed.

Behavior: disabled at game start, at game end (win screen), and any time the player can't afford the next undo; enables/disables dynamically during play.

### Round 3 — Menu closes immediately on "new game"

- Problem: `startNewGame()` raises an invisible full-screen interaction blocker while ~8s of card dealing animates, trapping the menu open.
- `js/ui.js` — new `closeMenu()` (idempotent, unlike `toggleMenu()`).
- `js/game.js` — `startNewGame()` calls `closeMenu()` as its first action, before the blocker goes up. Covers both the "new game" and "reset your stats" menu paths.

## How changes were verified

No build/test tooling — verified via `node --check --input-type=module < file` for syntax, plus headless Chrome against `python3 -m http.server`:

```sh
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --headless --disable-gpu \
  --virtual-time-budget=12000 --dump-dom http://localhost:8742/
```

(12s virtual time budget lets the full 8s card-deal animation finish before the DOM dump.)

## Remaining known issues / possible next steps

1. `wedge test/` folder is now fully ported into `js/statsGraph.js` — safe to delete.
2. `setRefreshCount` is listed in game.js's module index comment but never implemented; `refreshCount` was renamed/repurposed to `refreshCost` and is never incremented — dead code worth cleaning.
3. GSAP is loaded as a `<script>` global but used in modules without import — implicit global dependency (works fine, just untracked).
4. `// todo -> rename this function` comment on `updateCardStyle` in `js/ui.js`.
5. The win-screen stats graph (≤ 660px) follows the same code path as the verified header graph but hasn't been manually tested through a real game completion — worth a quick check (Olen mode, held on the title for 2s, makes finishing a game fast).
6. Mobile design work for the stats display was in progress last summer; the win-screen placement implemented this session was the chosen approach (originally specced at < 490px, widened to < 660px to avoid a no-graphic gap).
